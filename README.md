# Accident-Detection-and-IoT-Alert-System-Using-Arduino-and-NodeMCU
 This project uses an Arduino Uno with a GY-61 accelerometer to detect accidents by monitoring sudden acceleration changes. The danger status is sent to a NodeMCU via I2C, which updates a cloud server in real-time for remote monitoring and alerts.
